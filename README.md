# UNITE

This is a Lightkit meant for the 3D Program [Cinema4D](https://www.maxon.net/en-us/products/cinema-4d/overview/) and for usage on 3D Text Intros.

**If you have any problem or any request, just create an [issue](https://github.com/Luadih/unite-light/issues/new/choose) for it.**

## Download

### https://github.com/Luadih/unite-light/releases/latest
### Cinema 4D R19 or newer is recommended.
### The lightroom also works partially in R16, since all linked to Python won't work there, but the essentials part of the lightroom are made in Xpresso.
### Versions prior to R16 won't be at all supported nor made a backport for them.
