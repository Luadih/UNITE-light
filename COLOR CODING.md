# Color Coding / Formatting in Xpressos

## Formatting

- If the Xpresso operator name is surrounded by **brackets "{}"** is to represent they are **constants**.

- If the Xpresso operator name is surrounded by **square brackets "[]"** is to represent they are a **group of operators used for a single function**. They may respect the `BLURPLE` color code, or they may not. *Used mainly to improve readibility.*

## Global Color Codes

- WHITE : `#E6E6E6`
This is used for **Data Blocks**, they just store data triggered by other functions.

- PURPLE : `#A445CC`
This is **used mainly for the menu node**, but it *can* also be for the **main processing operators**.

- YELLOW WITH YELLOW BORDERS : `#FFE500`
This is for **notes left in Xpresso** to explain how everything works, they can be confused for error nodes so be *sure* **it says "NOTE" and it HAS a yellow border**.

- BLURPLE : `#8A8AE6`
This is for a **group of operators needed for a specific function**, they shouldn't need to be modified to introduce a new set. *You can open them by double clicking with SHIFT held.*

## GROUPING COLOR CODES

Some color codes that you can use for **grouping nodes used for one single function**.

- GREEN : `#45CC45`

- LIGHT BLUE : `#45CCCC`
